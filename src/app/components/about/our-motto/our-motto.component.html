                            <strong>Muhammed Ali (1942 - 2016)</strong> was a professional boxer and activist. He is regarded 
                            as one of the most significant sports figures of the 20th century and is often regarded as the greatest 
                            heavyweight boxer of all time. Besides his phenomenal boxing ability and achievements, Muhammed Ali was 
                            an activist and humanitarian. He received the Liberty Medal for his long-time role as an advocate for humanitarian 
                            causes, civil rights, and religious freedom. Ali was recognized as the "Champion of Freedom" for his unrelenting 
                            and persistent fight for equality, peace, and justice in every area of life, all over the world. Particularly his 
                            catchphrase <strong>‘Float like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee’</strong> resonates with our team.

                            <strong>The Butterfly Buard</strong> is one of the oldest and most traditional forms of guard playing in 
                            Jiu Jitsu- The Gentle Art is often labelled as a classic guard. The butterfly hooks are designed to jeopardize 
                            the base of the fighter. Although grappling has been a part of humanity since combat sports began, not much is 
                            shown about guard work in ancient paintings or scripts, and judo was thought to be the first martial art to truly 
                            open the awareness of this fighting form. The hooks guard (Butterfly guard) seems to have been one of the first 
                            recorded guard styles, a natural transition from a standing up position to the ground. Today the butterfly guard 
                            is commonly used by Jiu Jitsu practitioners all over the world and is part of The Butterfly Buard’s significant history.

                            <strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong> is a theory which states that everything in existence is connected, 
                            and one component cannot help, but affect the entirety of the other components, which comprise the universe. 
                            Think of it this way: small things turn into big things…It is the little actions that add up to make significant 
                            changes. By focusing on small daily efforts, in time, they will mount up to tremendous change. Our movement 
                            believes that one should never underestimate the power of their actions, as one small gesture can change a person’s 
                            life or start a movement of change. The butterfly has been a symbol of transformation, hope, and rebirth for 
                            thousands of years, especially with its unique life cycle from larva to caterpillar to chrysalis and finally to a 
                            beautiful, flying butterfly.
