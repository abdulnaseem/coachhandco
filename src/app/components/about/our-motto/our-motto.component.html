                    <h2>Our Motto - Educate | Empower |Exercise</h2>
                    <p>
                        By keeping empowerment as our body and our wings as 
                        education and empowerment we create the notion of self-belief. 
                        “The ability to empower an individual or a group can be best fostered 
                        through two streams, education and exercise,” (Coach.H) 2023.

                        <strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong> is a theory which states that everything in existence 
                        is connected and one component cannot help, but affect the entirety of the other 
                        components, which comprise the universe. Think of it this way: Small things turn into 
                        big things…It’s the little things that make up the big things. By focusing on doing small 
                        daily efforts, in time, they will mount up to big changes. Don’t ever underestimate the power 
                        of your actions. With one small gesture, you can change a person’s life or start a movement 
                        of change. The butterfly has been a symbol of transformation, hope and belief for thousands of 
                        years. The butterfly is also a symbol of rebirth, since it goes through so many life cycles from 
                        larva to caterpillar to chrysalis and finally to a beautiful, flying butterfly.

                        <Strong>The Butterfly Buard</Strong> is one of the oldest and most traditional forms of guard playing in 
                        Jiu Jitsu - The Gentle Art and is often labelled as a classic guard. The butterfly hooks are designed to 
                        jeopardize the base of the fighter. The History of the Butterfly Guard, although grappling has been 
                        part of humanity since combat sports began, not much is shown about guard work in ancient paintings or 
                        scripts, and judo was apparently the first martial art to truly open. The hooks guard (Butterfly guard) 
                        seems to have been one of the first recorded guard styles, a natural transition from stand up to the ground. 
                        Today the butterfly guard is commonly used by Jiu Jitsu practitioners all over the world.
