                            <strong>Abdul Hannan</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>‘Coach.H’</strong> is a social mobiliser and a mix martial artist 
                            from Tower Hamlets. Growing up through adverse poverty and socio-economic disadvantage, he developed 
                            a passion to create progressive change on a global and local scale by empowering hearts and minds 
                            through education and exercise. Now you may be questioning what (H) stands for. There have been numerous 
                            discussions regarding this topic. Some have said it stands for humanity and while others have said hero, 
                            but I guess I’ll leave that for you to decide!

                            The viewpoint that I embrace in life is with a deep understanding that youth and community work is not a 
                            9-5 job but rather a way of life. To bring the best out of young people and the wider community, 
                            we must be willing to give back to empower all those around us.

                            <strong>Brawlers Boxing (2013)</strong> - The love for sports inspired me to give back to the wider 
                            community and harbour community cohesion using my skills, knowledge, and experience. 
                            Shortly after the London 2012 Olympics, I initiated and founded a community project 
                            called ‘Brawlers Boxing’. The project arose to tackle youth delinquency, promote active 
                            participation, and better health. The movement went on to transform many lives, and along 
                            the way, won the ‘Tower Hamlets Community Safety Award’ by Metropolitan Police and ‘The 
                            English Asian Business Awards’ as finalists by Lloyds Bank.

                            <strong>The Grapple Hub (2022)</strong> - After piloting the project for 2 years, I 
                            successfully launched this MMA club. This community project promotes the sport of Brazilian 
                            Jiu Jitsu and grappling in the heart of the East End. It is a safe space for people to enjoy 
                            themselves, have fun and learn useful life skills with an aim to reduce the rates of delinquency 
                            and violent crimes in the area. The club follows the teachings of Bradley Hill who oversees the 
                            curriculum and grading. He is the youngest 2nd degree black belt in the UK and since our opening, 
                            the club has gained a variety of medals and has established a renowned reputation in our community.
